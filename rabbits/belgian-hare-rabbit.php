                <p>The Belgian Hare is not a true hare but rather a "fancy" (i.e., non-utilitarian) breed of domestic rabbit that has been selectively bred to resemble the wild hare. Averaging 6–9 pounds (2.7–4.1 kg), the Belgian Hare is known for its slender and wiry frame and its long and powerful legs.</p>
