        <p>The Flemish Giant rabbit is a very large breed of domestic rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus domesticus), normally considered to be the largest breed of the species. Flemish Giants are historically a utility breed bred for fur and meat. The breed is also known for being docile and patient in being handled, resulting in the large animals commonly being kept as pets.</p>
