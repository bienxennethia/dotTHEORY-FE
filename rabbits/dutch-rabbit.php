        <p>The Dutch rabbit, also known as Hollander or Brabander is easily identifiable by its characteristic colour pattern, and was once the most popular of all rabbit breeds. However, after dwarf rabbits were developed, the popularity of the Dutch rabbit dwindled. Nevertheless, the Dutch rabbit remains one of the top ten most popular breeds worldwide.</p>
        <p>"Although the name suggests that the Dutch rabbit is from the Netherlands, it was actually developed in England. During the 1830s rabbits were imported to England from Ostend in Belgium every week for the meat market. Amongst these rabbits was a breed known as the Petit Brabançon, as it originated from Brabant in Flanders. The Petit Brabançon may still be found in paintings from the fifteenth century. The Dutch rabbit has its genetic roots in this old breed. The Petit Brabançon would often display Dutch markings, and breeders in England selected those with even markings, fixing those markings into the breed we know today."</p>
        <p>Dutch are popular both as pets and among show breeders.</p>
