                <p>The Checkered Giant is a breed of domestic rabbit that originated in France (GÃ©ant Papillon in French). One of the largest rabbit breeds, the Checkered Giant is recognized by the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA).</p>
                <p>The Checkered Giant is one of the minority of rabbit breeds with specific coat markings. The markings defined in the breed standard of the Checkered Giant differ somewhat from those in the breed standard of the Giant Papillon. For ARBA show purposes, a mature Checkered Giant buck must weigh a minimum of 11 pounds (5.0 kg), and a mature doe must weigh a minimum of 12 pounds (5.4 kg). ARBA does not specify a maximum weight for Checkered Giants.</p>
