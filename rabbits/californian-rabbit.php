                <p>The Californian, also known as the California White, is a breed of domestic rabbit originally developed for the fur and meat industries by George S. West of Lynwood, California, starting in 1923. Mr. West maintained a herd of 300 genetically pure New Zealand Whites (with no Angora genes), which he began crossing with Standard Chinchilla rabbits (for their dense coat) and Himalayan rabbits (from which the Californian's markings come). His new breed, named for the state of its origin, was first shown in 1928 and a standard was accepted by the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA) in 1939.</p>
