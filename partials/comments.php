                    <p class="comments__lists-comment">Rabbits have a special place to me, just because they were my first sole responsibility to take care of. And they were such fascinating animals too, especially to grow up with them and learn how they behave and that they have their own personality exactly like a person. I loved owning rabbits and would recommend them to anyone who's not allergic to them.</p>
