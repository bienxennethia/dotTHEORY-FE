                <p>There is some confusion about what a rabbit should eat. For the most part, a rabbit’s diet should consist of 75 to 80% hay. More importantly, the hay should be high-quality timothy hay, grass hay, or meadow hay. When a rabbit is in its natural habitat, their diet is high in fiber. This diet consists of mostly grass, leafy plants, and bark. The diet of a domestic rabbit should imitate these eating habits. Hay, fresh vegetables/herbs, and a small number of fiber nuggets are the base of a pet rabbit’s diet. When feeding a pet rabbit, the owner should try to keep the rabbit’s diet consistent. Changing the rabbit’s diet frequently can have a negative effect on their sensitive digestive systems.</p>
                <p>Although many people believe rabbits love lettuce; it is important to remember that feeding a rabbit lettuce can lead to GI stasis. For that reason, never feed your rabbit lettuce. There are many other foods an owner should not feed a rabbit. These foods include items that are high in carbohydrates like cookies, bread, cereal, crackers, chips, and pretzels. Additionally, never feed a rabbit chocolate. In most cases, chocolate is toxic to rabbits.</p>

                        <p class="table__list-item-description">Fresh hay should create the bulk of the rabbit’s diet. Hay needs to be available to the rabbit at all times. It is important to remember that younger rabbits eat alfalfa. This is hay that is high in protein and sugar. Alfalfa should never be fed to adult rabbits. It is a good idea to place hay at the end of the litter box. Rabbits tend to poop while eating hay and this will encourage the use of the litter box.</p>

                        <p class="table__list-item-description">A daily variety of vegetables should be a part of the rabbit’s diet. If feeding vegetables to a rabbit, feed the rabbit fresh and pesticide-free vegetables. When introducing new vegetables into the rabbit’s diet, use small quantities, in the beginning, to judge how the rabbit will react to them. Rabbits typically enjoy broccoli leaves, carrot tops, celery, parsley, and watercress.</p>

                        <p class="table__list-item-description">Freshwater should always be available in the rabbit’s cage at all times. Hanging a water bottle is a great option. If the rabbit is not drinking enough water; it is a good idea to leave the rabbit’s vegetables reasonably wet.</p>

                        <p class="table__list-item-description">Fresh pellets should be fed to a rabbit sparingly. The best pellets are low in protein and high in fiber. It is important to limit the rabbit’s pellet intake as the rabbit ages. This is primarily because pellets can be high in protein and this can cause health issues and obesity.</p>

Fruit is usually the best option for a treat, but in small amounts because of the amount of sugar. Fruits that rabbits enjoy include apples, strawberries, pineapples, raspberries, and bananas.</p>
